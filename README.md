# Customer_churn_Prediction
Churn prediction is a data-driven approach used to identify customers or users likely to stop using a product or service. It is a critical task for businesses aiming to retain customers, reduce revenue loss, and improve customer satisfaction. Evaluate this, By these machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and KNN.
## Churn prediction has applications across industries:  <br>
**Telecommunications:** Predicting which subscribers are likely to switch to competitors.<br>
**Retail:** Identifying customers who may stop shopping.<br>
**Banking:** Preventing account closures or loan payoffs.<br>
**SaaS/Subscription Services:** Retaining users who might cancel their subscriptions. <br>
## Techniques for Reducing Churn <br>
**Targeted Campaigns:** Personalized offers for at-risk customers. <br>
**Improved Customer Support:** Proactively addressing complaints or issues. <br>
**Loyalty Programs:** Rewarding long-term users. <br>
**Service Improvements:** Enhancing product or service quality. <br>
## Challenges in Churn Prediction <br>
**Class Imbalance:** Churn cases may be far fewer than non-churn cases. <br>
**Data Quality:** Missing, incomplete, or irrelevant data can skew results. <br>
**Changing Trends:** Customer behavior and preferences evolve over time. <br>
## Steps in Churn Prediction: <br>
**a. Problem Understanding** <br>
Define churn and establish the business goals, such as improving retention rates or reducing customer acquisition costs. <br>
**b. Data Collection** <br>
Collect relevant data, such as: <br>
•	Demographic Data: Age, gender, location. <br>

</p>
•	Behavioral Data: Login frequency, transaction history, service usage. <br>
•	Transactional Data: Purchase history, payment failures. <br>
•	Feedback Data: Customer complaints, survey responses. <br>
**c. Data Preprocessing** <br>
•	Handling Missing Values: Fill or remove missing data points. <br>

</p>
•	Normalization/Scaling: Ensure data is consistent for algorithms. <br>
**d. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** <br>
•	Understand the Dataset and correlations in the data. <br>

</p>
•	Visualize churned vs. non-churned users. <br>

</p>
•	Identify significant factors influencing churn. <br>
**e. Model Building** <br>
Select and train appropriate machine learning models, such as: <br>
•	Logistic Regression: Baseline binary classification. <br>
•	Random Forests: For feature importance and handling non-linear relationships. <br>
•	Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): For high accuracy. <br>
•	k-Nearest Neighbors(k-NN): For complex relationships with larger datasets. <br>
•	Support Vector Machine: SVM is a powerful and flexible algorithm used in a wide variety of machine learning tasks. <br>
•	Support Vector Machine: Decision trees provide a clear, interpretable way of understanding how predictions are made. <br>
**f. Model Evaluation** <br>
Evaluate the model using metrics like: <br>
•	Accuracy: Overall prediction correctness. <br>

</p>
•	Precision and Recall: Focus on churners. <br>
•	F1-Score: Balance between precision and recall. <br>
Overall Measure the Model Performance. From the following graph, we can see that the Random Forest Classifier model has the best accuracy.

**g. Deployment and Monitoring** <br>
Deploy the model to predict churn for live data and monitor performance over time. <br>
